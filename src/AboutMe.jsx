            Hi, I'm Prakhar ‚Äî a full-stack developer who thrives on solving real business problems with code.<br /><br />
            My strengths are rapid prototyping, clean UI/UX, and building scalable systems that just work. I love collaborating with ambitious teams and founders who value speed, reliability, and a user-first mindset.<br /><br />
            What drives me? The challenge of turning ideas into products that make a difference. Whether it's automating workflows, improving performance, or making apps more accessible, I bring energy and ownership to every project.<br /><br />
